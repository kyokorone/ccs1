<pre title="part 1 classics" style="color:white; text-align:center;">
sometimes, somehow, there are songs that i'll truly never get sick of. whether it's because of the memories such a
song may hold, or simply just because it's an really great song, i'll always consider it an all-time fave if it's one
that i still enjoy a ton after months or years. mostly, these songs have consisted of indie pop/rock (crazy4luvinu by
katsu oso, draem girl by no vacation, nicotine stains by second thoughts, etc.) and jpop (love zukkyun by soutaiseiriron,
notice me by moe shop, please do not be happy by kobasolo & harutya, etc.).

<pre title="part 2 music taste" style="color:white; text-align:left;">
my music taste has changed and developed a whole lot since i was young. i started diving into music more when i was in
grade 5 (so around when i was 11). i started with listening to the top 100 pop playlists and some of the music my favorite
youtubers liked. however now, i like to think that what i listen to now is a melting pot of myself and the people around me. </pre>


<pre title="part two jpop" style="color:white; text-align:left;">
for instance, one of the reasons i've fallen back in love with japanese pop is because of some of my close friends...
they're absolute weebs. from hololive, kana hanazawa to YAKUSHIMARU etsuko, and admittedly a bit of vocaloids, i wouldn't 
have dived back into them had it not been for my friends. especially etsuko & soutaiseiriron, two of my favorites, since 
they're quite niche i believe.
